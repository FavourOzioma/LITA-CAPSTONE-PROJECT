# LITA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT

--------
### HOW I STARTED MY LITA JOURNEY 
I had the opportunity to undergo this very training organised by our mummy G.O in the Redeemed Christian Church Of God
the journey was not all smooth because of the difficulty not joining the class presently but i had the opportunity to 
watch the video on youtube, it was not easy i must say, but today here i am as a certified LITA(Ladies In Tech Afria).
no matter what always be focused in whatever you want to achieve and believe in yourself and you will come out successful
and with great achievements.

### MY CAPSTONE PROJECT
Today i am opportuned to submit my first project here, and i hope you find it motivating and insightful,
my projects includes;
1. Excel
2. SQL and
3. Power BI.

--------
### BREAKDOWN ON WHAT THEY CONTAIN
1. Excel; it contains an analysed data that talks about the average of the data.
2. SQL; It also contains an analysed data but in a different format due to the data tool used.
3. Power BI; It contains data cleaning and visualisation of data, visualising of data makes it more attractive to 
to want to know more about it, and it makes it beautiful to behold as well when you use the right colours.
